React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React is used to build single-page applications.
React allows us to create reusable UI components.


import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

function Hello() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  );
}

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <Hello />
);


What is React?
React is a front-end JavaScript library.
React was developed by the Facebook Software Engineer Jordan Walke.
React is also known as React.js or ReactJS.
React is a tool for building UI components.



How does React Work?
React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
React only changes what needs to be changed!
React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.


The Container
React uses a container to render HTML in a web page.
Typically, this container is a <div id="root"></div> element in the index.html file.


The render Method
Did you notice the render method?
The render method defines what to render in the HTML container.
The result is displayed in the <div id="root"> element.

Example:
Display a paragraph inside the "root" element:

main.jsx
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <p>Welcome!</p>
) 


What is ES6?
ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6.

ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015, and is also known as ECMAScript 2015.



Why Should I Learn ES6?
React uses ES6, and you should be familiar with some of the new features like:

Classes
Arrow Functions
Variables (let, const, var)
Array Methods like .map()
Destructuring
Modules
Ternary Operator
Spread Operator


What is JSX?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.



Coding JSX
JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()  and/or appendChild() methods.
JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.



Expressions
You can insert any valid JavaScript expression inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces { }.
React will evaluate the expression and render the result in the DOM.


Variables
Variables are also valid expressions. Insert variables in JSX by wrapping it in curly braces { }.
