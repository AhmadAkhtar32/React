React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React is used to build single-page applications.
React allows us to create reusable UI components.


import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

function Hello() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  );
}

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <Hello />
);

React is a tool for building UI components.



How does React Work?
React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
React only changes what needs to be changed!
React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed.


The Container
React uses a container to render HTML in a web page.
Typically, this container is a <div id="root"></div> element in the index.html file.
