//Template literals (also called template strings) are a powerful string feature in JavaScript that use backticks (`) instead of regular quotes. They provide a more flexible way to create and format strings.

// Regular strings
const regular = "Hello world";
const alsoRegular = 'Hello world';

// Template literal
const template = `Hello world`;


// The most common use is embedding expressions using ${}
