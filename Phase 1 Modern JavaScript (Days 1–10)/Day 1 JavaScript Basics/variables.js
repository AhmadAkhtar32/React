// Variables are the Conatainers That store Data

// Always a Good practice to use Let in code as var have chances for bug

let a = "Ahmad";
{
    let a = 1;
    console.log(a);
}
console.log(a);     //This defines that let is block-scoped 


// Constant Can't be changed 

const b = "Ahsan "
console.log(b)

// Always try not to use var , use let and const if variable value have not to be chnaged
